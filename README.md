# how-to-rediscover-the-higgs-with-photons-master

This notebook is to get a felling of how to do a real analysis. ATLAS Open Data http://opendata.atlas.cern has been used to rediscover the Higgs boson yourself!

The datasets used in this notebook have already been filtered to include at least 2 photons per event, so that processing is quicker.

This analysis loosely follows the discovery of the Higgs boson by ATLAS https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.7214.pdf (mostly Section 5 and 5.1)

Feynman diagrams can be found at https://www.particlezoo.net

#### source, the main notebook can be found at

#### I edited it to be somehow simpiler and make sure the codes are compatible with the newer version of uproot (uproot4).
